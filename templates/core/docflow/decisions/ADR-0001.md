# ADR-0001: Establish Docflow decision process

## Context
Define how ADRs are authored, reviewed, accepted, and deprecated.

## Decision
Adopt `docflow/templates/adr.md` for all decisions. Each ADR includes context, decision, consequences, alternatives, and references. Status transitions follow Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated/Superseded.

## Consequences
Clear, searchable decision history; consistent format for human+agent parsing.

## Alternatives Considered
- Ad-hoc decision logging in issues/PRs
- No formal decision log

## References
- `docflow/decisions/README.md`
