# Purpose
Provide reliable testing guidance suitable for mobile apps.

# Opinionated Defaults
- Jest + RN Testing Library; Detox optional
- Minimal mocks; stable selectors

# Structure
- `tests/unit/**`, `tests/e2e/**`

# Conventions
- Keep Detox scenarios short; isolate flakey flows

# CI Hooks
- Separate unit vs e2e; device/simulator setup documented

# Checks (Agent)
- Config presence; predictable test naming; Detox gated by param
