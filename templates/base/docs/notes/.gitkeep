# Session Notes & Decision Records

This directory contains daily session notes tracking project evolution, decisions, and insights.

Files are named by date: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Follow the WrapSession Protocol documented in `/docs/project/workflows.md` for systematic capture of:
- Decision records
- Scope changes  
- Architectural insights
- Process changes
- Important context

This ensures project evolution and decision rationale are preserved for future development sessions.
