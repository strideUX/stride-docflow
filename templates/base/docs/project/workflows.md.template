# Project Workflows & Protocols

## WrapSession Protocol

### Purpose
Systematic capture of session decisions, changes, and insights to maintain project context and evolution tracking for {{projectName}}.

### When to Use
- End of significant development/planning sessions
- After major decisions or scope changes
- When architectural insights emerge
- Before handoffs between team members or AI assistants

### Protocol Steps

#### 1. Create or Locate Daily Notes File
- Check if file exists for today: `/docs/notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- If not exists, create using template format
- If exists, append new timestamped section

#### 2. Identify Session Content to Capture
Capture any of these significant events:
- **DECISION RECORD**: Architectural, technical, or strategic decisions
- **SCOPE CHANGE**: Modifications to timeline, features, or project scope  
- **INSIGHT**: Important design discoveries or realizations
- **CHANGE**: Structural, process, or workflow modifications
- **NOTE**: Context, observations, or important information

#### 3. Use Standard Entry Format
```markdown
## HH:MM - ENTRY_TYPE: Brief Description
**Type:** [Category/Impact Area]
**Impact:** [High/Medium/Low] - [Area of impact]
**Previous State:** [What it was before, if applicable]
**New State:** [What it is now]
**Rationale:** [Why this change/decision was made]
**Affects:** [What systems, processes, or areas this impacts]
**Action Required:** [Any follow-up needed]
```

#### 4. Cross-Reference Updates
When creating session notes, also update:
- `/docs/active/focus.md` if priorities change
- `/docs/active/session.md` for handoff context
- Relevant project documents if core specifications change

### Integration with Development Workflow

#### Daily Development Sessions
1. Start session by reviewing `/docs/active/focus.md` and latest notes
2. Work on assigned tasks and features
3. Before ending session, run WrapSession protocol for significant changes
4. Update focus document with next session priorities

#### Architecture and Planning Sessions  
1. Capture all major decisions using DECISION RECORD format
2. Document scope changes with impact analysis
3. Record insights about user needs or technical approaches
4. Update core project documentation if fundamental changes occur

#### Handoff Sessions
1. Create comprehensive session handoff in `/docs/active/session.md`
2. Capture context in notes for future reference
3. Ensure all decisions and changes are documented
4. Provide clear next steps and priorities

## QuickStart Protocol

### Purpose
Provide immediate, concise status and next actions when resuming development work on {{projectName}}. No verbose explanations - just essential context.

### When to Use
- Starting a new development session with AI assistants
- Need rapid context switching between tasks
- Want focused, actionable next steps without long explanations

### Usage
**Prompt:** "Execute QuickStart protocol - where are we and what's next?"

### Response Format
```markdown
## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status
**Phase:** [Current development phase]
**Priority:** [P0/P1/P2] [Current high-priority task]
**Blockers:** [Any immediate blockers or dependencies]

## âš¡ Next Actions
1. [Immediate next task - specific and actionable]
2. [Secondary task if first is blocked]
3. [Third option/alternative approach]

## ðŸ“‹ Context Check
- [ ] Active focus updated? (/docs/active/focus.md)
- [ ] Latest notes reviewed? (/docs/notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md)  
- [ ] Any decisions pending documentation?

## ðŸš¨ Alerts
[Any urgent issues, breaking changes, or critical dependencies]
```

### Implementation Steps
When QuickStart is requested:
1. Check `/docs/active/focus.md` for current priorities
2. Review latest `/docs/notes/` file for recent decisions
3. Scan `/docs/releases/current/` for active feature status
4. Identify immediate blockers or dependencies
5. Provide 1-3 specific, actionable next steps

## Quick Reference Commands

### For AI Assistants
**WrapSession System Prompt:**
> "Please refer to WrapSession Protocol in /docs/project/workflows.md and follow the outlined process for capturing significant session decisions, changes, or insights."

**WrapSession Direct Invocation:**
> "Please execute the WrapSession protocol to capture the key decisions and changes from our current discussion."

**QuickStart Direct Invocation:**
> "Execute QuickStart protocol - where are we and what's next?"

### Manual Process
1. Check today's date: `YYYY-MM-DD`
2. Open or create `/docs/notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. Add timestamped entry using standard format
4. Update cross-references as needed
5. Commit changes to preserve context
