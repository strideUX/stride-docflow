## Architectural Decisions

<!-- STATIC -->
*Use this section to document significant technical decisions made during development. Each decision should include context, the decision made, rationale, and trade-offs considered.*

### Decision Template
```
### Decision N: [Decision Title]
**Context:** [What situation led to this decision?]
**Decision:** [What was decided?]
**Rationale:** [Why was this chosen?]
**Trade-offs:** [What were the alternatives and their pros/cons?]
**Status:** [Active/Superseded/Deprecated]
**Date:** [When was this decided?]
```
