# Wrap Session

## Overview
Save your progress and prepare for a clean resumption of work later.

## Steps

1. **Review Current Work**
   - Check all specs in /specs/active/
   - Note the status of each spec
   - Identify what was accomplished this session

2. **Update Acceptance Criteria & Status**
   - Mark any completed criteria with [x]
   - Note partially completed items
   - **Update spec status based on progress:**
     - If all criteria complete and Implementation Notes filled → status should be REVIEW
     - If implementation ongoing → status should be IMPLEMENTING or READY
     - If DocFlow work → update as needed

3. **Update Decision Log**
   - Add entry with today's date
   - Document key decisions made
   - Note any pivots or changes
   - Record blockers encountered

4. **Check Status-Specific Actions**
   - **IMPLEMENTING**: Ensure progress is documented in spec
   - **REVIEW**: If you've completed review, follow review workflow
   - **READY**: No action needed (queued for implementation)

5. **Update ACTIVE.md**
   - Update "Last Updated" date
   - Add brief status note if needed
   - Update Primary/Secondary Focus based on status changes

6. **Update Dependencies**
   - If new shared code was created, ensure it's in dependencies.md
   - Document any new connections discovered
