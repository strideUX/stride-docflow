# Session Notes: August 17, 2025

## Session Overview
**Duration:** Extended documentation review and workflow refinement  
**Focus:** Establish proper daily notes pattern and complete conversational AI architecture documentation  
**Participants:** User + Claude (AI Documentation Consultant)  
**Outcome:** Complete documentation alignment and workflow protocol clarification

## 16:45 - DECISION RECORD: True Conversational AI Architecture Required
**Type:** Major Architecture Revision
**Impact:** High - Complete redefinition of conversation engine approach
**Previous State:** RealConversationEngine implemented as structured form with better prompts
**New State:** Need true conversational AI with dynamic question generation and LLM-driven flow
**Rationale:** Current implementation is still linear prompts, not conversational. User wants open-ended conversation like human consultant interview, not smart forms
**Affects:** F001 implementation approach, conversation engine design, AI integration strategy
**Action Required:** Complete redesign of conversation architecture

**Key Requirements Identified:**
1. **True Conversation Flow**: AI asks follow-up questions based on responses, not predefined sequence
2. **Provider Flexibility**: Default provider but runtime override capability (OpenAI/Anthropic focus)
3. **Discovery Scope**: Use our own docs structure as system prompt - AI needs info to generate specs.md, architecture.md, features.md, stack.md
4. **Conversation Style**: Technical consultant interview, requirements gathering, lighter tone but SME-guided
5. **Memory Strategy**: Session-based memory that dies after doc generation - docs become source of truth
6. **Industry Standard**: 10-15 meaningful turns for requirements gathering to avoid decision fatigue

**Architecture Components Needed:**
- **ConversationOrchestrator**: Uses docs structure as discovery template, manages conversation flow
- **System Prompt Strategy**: "Technical consultant gathering requirements to generate specific document types"
- **Dynamic Question Generation**: AI generates next question based on conversation history and gaps
- **Discovery Gap Assessment**: Evaluates what information is still needed for complete documentation
- **Provider/Model Flexibility**: Runtime configuration for AI provider and model selection

**Meta Approach:**
- Use this project to document itself using the conversational approach
- Create feedback loop to refine system based on real usage
- Future evolution path: Single orchestrator → Specialized agents → Agent collaboration

**Evolution Roadmap:**
- Phase 1: Single conversation orchestrator (current focus)
- Phase 2: Specialized domain agents (architecture, UX, features)
- Phase 3: Multi-agent collaboration for complex projects

## 17:00 - CHANGE: Establish Proper Daily Notes Pattern
**Type:** Process Enhancement
**Impact:** Medium - Improves workflow consistency and note organization
**Previous State:** Single 2025-08-15.md file being updated across multiple days
**New State:** Daily notes files with clear separation (one file per day)
**Rationale:** Daily notes pattern improves organization and follows intended workflow design
**Affects:** Note capture protocol, workflow documentation, team handoff processes
**Action Required:** Update protocols to clarify daily file creation and management

**Pattern Established:**
- Create new file for each day: `/docs/notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- If day's file exists, append to it
- If day's file doesn't exist, create new one
- Keep historical files untouched (preserve decision history)

*Session notes continue as new decisions and changes are made throughout the day.*
