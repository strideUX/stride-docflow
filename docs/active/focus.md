# Current Focus: Conversational Docflow Implementation

## Today's Priority: Documentation Analysis & Gap Identification

**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Phase:** Planning & Design  
**Next Session Goal:** Identify gaps between current template system and conversational vision

## Current State Analysis

### What We've Accomplished âœ…
- Created comprehensive project specifications following proper information hierarchy
- Documented conversational AI architecture with clear component separation
- Designed three-phase user experience flow (Discovery â†’ Design â†’ Generation)
- Established document purpose framework to replace static templates
- Updated Docflow README with documentation philosophy for future reference

### Key Insights from Documentation Exercise ðŸ’¡
1. **Current template system is rigid** - fills predefined structures rather than understanding purpose
2. **Missing conversational intelligence** - no way to ask clarifying questions or build understanding
3. **Document disconnection** - generated sections lack cohesion and cross-references
4. **One-shot generation limitation** - no iterative refinement or user collaboration

### Gaps Identified ðŸŽ¯
1. **Conversation Engine**: Need complete replacement of current batch generation with interactive AI
2. **Context Management**: Current system has no persistent conversation state or context building
3. **Purpose Framework**: Templates need to become purpose-driven document definitions
4. **User Experience**: CLI needs conversational interface instead of form-filling prompts

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Session)
- [ ] Review current codebase structure to understand integration points
- [ ] Identify which components can be evolved vs need complete replacement
- [ ] Plan implementation approach: gradual enhancement vs clean rewrite
- [ ] Define MVP scope for initial conversational prototype

### Short-term Development Plan (Next 2 weeks)
- [ ] Prototype conversation engine with basic project discovery
- [ ] Design context management data structures and persistence
- [ ] Create document purpose registry to replace template system
- [ ] Build iterative refinement interface for generated content

### Questions to Resolve
- Should we build conversational features as CLI flags (`--conversational`) or replace current approach entirely?
- How do we maintain backward compatibility for existing Docflow users?
- What's the minimal viable conversation that demonstrates the approach?
- Which AI provider should we prototype with first (OpenAI GPT-5, Claude, or local)?

## Implementation Approach Decision

Based on documentation analysis, recommend **gradual enhancement approach**:

1. **Phase 1**: Add conversational mode as optional CLI flag alongside existing templates
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate successful patterns from conversational mode to replace templates  
3. **Phase 3**: Fully replace template system with conversational approach as default

This allows:
- User testing and feedback during development
- Backward compatibility during transition
- Risk mitigation with fallback to working system
- Iterative improvement based on real usage

## Code Areas Requiring Change

### Major Modifications Needed
- `src/prompts/project.ts` - Replace form prompts with conversation engine
- `src/generators/ai-generator.ts` - Enhance from section-filling to purpose-driven generation
- `src/generators/docs.ts` - Replace template processing with conversational workflow

### New Components Required
- `src/conversation/` - New conversation engine and phase management
- `src/context/` - Context management and persistence
- `src/purposes/` - Document purpose framework and registry

### Integration Points
- Maintain existing CLI framework and beautiful terminal experience
- Preserve AI provider abstraction and error handling
- Keep file generation and organization patterns
- Retain progress indicators and user feedback systems

*Focus will shift to prototyping conversation engine once architectural analysis is complete.*
