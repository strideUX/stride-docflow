# Project Specifications: Conversational AI Documentation Generator

## Vision Statement

Transform Docflow from a template-based documentation generator into an intelligent AI documentation consultant that collaboratively builds purposeful, comprehensive project documentation through natural conversation.

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Conversational AI Documentation Generator (Docflow v2)  
**Project Type:** CLI Enhancement & AI-Powered Documentation Platform  
**Current State:** Design & Planning Phase  
**Target Users:** Technical project leads, development teams, product managers

## Core Problem

The current template-based approach creates generic documentation that doesn't capture project-specific needs or allow for iterative refinement. Users need a collaborative AI consultant that understands documentation purposes and builds exactly what their project requires.

## Solution Approach

### Three-Phase Collaborative Process

**Phase 1: Project Discovery & Specifications**
- AI conducts deep exploratory conversation about project goals, users, and constraints
- Builds comprehensive project understanding through targeted questions
- Produces detailed specifications with user validation

**Phase 2: Design & Architecture Planning**  
- AI proposes technical approaches based on specifications
- Interactive refinement of architectural decisions
- Creates cohesive technical design documentation

**Phase 3: Comprehensive Documentation Generation**
- Generates complete documentation suite with full context awareness
- Each document serves specific purposes for different stakeholders
- User can iterate and refine any aspect while AI maintains consistency

## Key User Stories

### Primary: Technical Project Lead
*"As a technical project lead starting a new project, I want an AI consultant to help me think through all aspects of my project and generate documentation that actually serves my team's needs."*

### Secondary: Development Team
*"As a developer on the team, I want documentation that clearly explains decisions and provides implementation guidance that matches our actual architecture."*

### Tertiary: Stakeholders & Product Managers
*"As a stakeholder, I want to understand project scope and progress through clear, accurate documentation that connects technical decisions to business objectives."*

## Core Capabilities

### Conversational Discovery Engine
- Natural language project exploration
- Context-aware follow-up questions
- Progressive understanding building
- User validation at each phase

### Purpose-Driven Documentation
- Document types defined by stakeholder needs and purposes
- Content tailored to specific audiences
- Cross-document consistency and interconnection
- Iterative refinement with context preservation

### Context Management System
- Comprehensive project understanding across all phases
- Consistent terminology and concepts throughout
- Version history and change tracking
- Context-aware regeneration when changes occur

## Success Criteria

### User Experience
- 90%+ of users report generated documentation is "significantly better" than template-based approach
- Users successfully implement projects using generated documentation
- Documentation requires minimal manual editing post-generation

### Technical Performance
- Complete documentation generation under 10 minutes for typical project
- AI maintains context accuracy across 50+ conversation turns
- System gracefully handles conversation interruptions and resumptions

### Content Quality
- Documentation serves the needs of all identified stakeholders
- Technical accuracy validated by domain experts
- Consistent terminology and concepts throughout

## Technology Foundation

**AI Integration:** OpenAI GPT-4/5, Anthropic Claude, local model support  
**CLI Framework:** Node.js, TypeScript, Clack for beautiful terminal experience  
**Context Management:** Efficient conversation state management and retrieval  
**File Generation:** Markdown output with structured organization

## Future Vision

This conversational approach establishes the foundation for advanced features like team collaboration, custom document types, code generation integration, and enterprise workflow management.
