# Features: Conversational AI Documentation Generator v2.0

## Feature Overview

This release introduces three major feature categories that transform Docflow from template-based to conversational AI-driven documentation generation.

## Phase 1 Features: Conversation Engine

### F001: AI Project Discovery Engine
**Status:** ðŸ”„ Active - In Review (Architecture Redesign Required)  
**Priority:** P0 - Critical  
**Complexity:** High - True conversational AI architecture  
**Dependencies:** None  

**Description:**  
Conversational AI system that conducts requirements gathering like a technical consultant, using dynamic question generation and natural dialogue flow to build comprehensive project understanding.

**Completed Items:**
- âœ… Conversation engine interfaces and type definitions
- âœ… NoopConversationEngine scaffolding implementation
- âœ… `--conversational` CLI flag integration
- âœ… Context store interfaces with in-memory implementation
- âœ… Unit test coverage for conversation engine structure
- âœ… Non-breaking integration with existing command flow
- âœ… RealConversationEngine initial implementation (needs redesign)

**ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Current implementation is structured form, not conversational AI**

**Revised Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] **True Conversation Flow**: AI generates dynamic follow-up questions based on user responses (not predefined prompts)
- [ ] **Consultant-Style Interview**: Technical requirements gathering with lighter tone, SME-guided questioning
- [ ] **Document-Driven Discovery**: AI knows it needs information to generate specs.md, architecture.md, features.md, stack.md
- [ ] **Provider Flexibility**: Configurable AI provider (OpenAI/Anthropic) with runtime model override
- [ ] **Conversation Management**: 10-15 meaningful turns, gap assessment, completion detection
- [ ] **Session Memory**: Context persists during session, dies after doc generation

**Required Architecture Components:**
- [x] **ConversationOrchestrator**: Main conversation manager using docs structure as discovery template
- [x] **Dynamic Question Generator**: AI-powered next question generation based on conversation history
- [x] **Discovery Gap Assessor**: Evaluates what information is still needed for complete documentation  
- [ ] **System Prompt Integration**: Use our own docs structure to define required information
- [ ] **Provider Configuration**: Runtime AI provider and model selection
- [ ] **Convex AI Integration**: Replace file-based session storage with Convex AI SDK for streaming, persistence, and multi-agent foundation

**Technical Implementation:**
- âœ… Basic conversation interfaces (extended with orchestrator)
- âœ… CLI integration foundation
- âœ… Conversational flow introduced via `ConversationOrchestrator`
- ðŸ”„ Document requirements extraction from our own docs structure (in progress)
- [ ] AI provider abstraction with runtime configuration
- [ ] Convex AI SDK integration for message streaming and persistence
- [ ] Replace file-based ConversationSessionManager with Convex database storage

**Meta Approach:**
- Use this project to document itself with the conversational approach
- Create feedback loop to refine conversation quality
- Future evolution: Single orchestrator â†’ Domain agents â†’ Multi-agent collaboration
