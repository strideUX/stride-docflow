# Review

## Overview
Review and refine a backlog item to prepare it for active work.

## Steps

1. **Select Item**
   - Show items from /specs/backlog/
   - Ask: "Which item would you like to review?"

2. **Check Completeness**
   - Does it have clear context?
   - Are acceptance criteria specific and testable?
   - Are dependencies identified?
   - Is technical approach documented?

3. **Ask Clarifying Questions**
   If incomplete, gather:
   - User story clarity
   - Technical constraints
   - Dependency verification
   - Success criteria definition

4. **Refine Spec**
   - Update Context section
   - Add/improve Acceptance Criteria
   - Document Technical Approach
   - Identify Dependencies
   - Add to Decision Log

5. **Determine Readiness**
   - Ask: "Is this ready to activate?"
   - If yes: Move to active via /start-session
   - If no: Note what's still needed

6. **Update Priority**
   - If priorities changed, update INDEX.md
   - Ensure backlog is ordered correctly
